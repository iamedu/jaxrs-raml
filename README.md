JaxRS Raml
===========

JaxRS RAML is our own half complete JaxRS implementation that supports
validation and definition with raml files. 

Why?
-----

APIs are very important in our lives, we love them and we depend on them so we decided to use RAML in order to be able to talk about them.

It is a pretty nice definition language that you should check out.

The point is that we wanted tools that now only allow us to write our code
faster, we also wanted tools that force us to maintain and update
documentation and help us not to repeat ourselves.
